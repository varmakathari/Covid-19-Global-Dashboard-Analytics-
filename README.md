# Covid-19-Global-Dashboard-Analytics:
This project proposes a plan to investigate the Covid-19 impact on the world. It cites the research question that covers the topics such as the vaccination rates, newly confirmed cases and the gender- based analysis. The data analysis is done using the descriptive analysis and then the data visualization 
using Tableau. This project provides a summary of key findings of the ongoing nature of the pandemic, the vaccination rates and the public health outcomes. Finally, the project emphasizes the reason for being ethically considerate and being updated on the user interactions, frequency of the spread and the resource planning to ensure that a strategic approach is followed to address the Covid-19 spread through Data Analysis and Data Visualization.
